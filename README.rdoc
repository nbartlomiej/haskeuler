==About

This project contains Haskell solutions to some of the Project Euler's problems
(http://projecteuler.net/problems).

Browsing the source will most likely spoil some of the fun of solving Project
Euler problems by yourself. One the other hand, it may inspire the Reader to
correct my code or to solve remaining riddles.

This project serves also as a playground for another experiment, writing
Haskell code on a mobile device (iPad). Here is a post from my blog with
more details:

.

==Constraints

All programs should meet the following requirements:

* The number one priority is code readability.
* When run via runhaskell the execution time must not exceed one minute.

==Running

Make sure you have Haskell Platform installed
(http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/). Execute in console:

    $ runhaskell ./001/problem-001.hs

==Contributing

You're invited!
